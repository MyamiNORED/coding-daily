/*
 *
 * a loop is a statement whose job is to repeatedly execute 
 * some other statement (the loop body).In C, every loop has a controlling expression
 * each time the loop body is executed (an iteration of the loop),the controlling 
 * expression is evaluated :if the expression is true has a value thats not zero-
 * the loop continues to execute.*/

/*while loop ...the controlling expression is tested before the loop body is executed
 * do loop ...the expression is tested after the loop body is executed
 * for loop .. is convenient for loops that increment or decrement a counting var*/
