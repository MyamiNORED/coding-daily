/* Exercise 1: Factorial Calculator




Write a program that calculates the factorial of a given positive integer using a function. The function should take an integer as input and return its factorial.   

n! = n * (n-1) * (n-2) * (n-3) * (n-4) *.....*3*2*1

0! = 1 

1! = 1 

2! = 2 * 1 

3! = 3 * 2 * 1
